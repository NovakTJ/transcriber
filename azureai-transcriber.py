    # In a real-world scenario, you'd generate a SAS token with appropriate permissions

    # For batch transcription, a SAS URI is typically required.
    # Let's construct a placeholder for now, as direct SAS generation requires account key which is not ideal for env var.
    # A more robust solution would involve a Managed Identity or Service Principal for authentication.
    # For a quick test, you might make the container public read, but NOT recommended for production.
    # For this code, we'll assume the batch transcription API can access the blob via its name
    # if the Speech Service has the correct role-based access to the storage account.
    # A common pattern is to grant the Speech Service Managed Identity "Storage Blob Data Reader" role.

    # For a proper batch transcription, you'd need a SAS URL. Let's simulate it for now.

    # For the purpose of this script, let's assume the Speech Service has permissions to read from the container.
    # If not, you'd need to generate a SAS URL here:
    # audio_input_url = f"{blob_client.url}?{sas_token}" # where sas_token is generated securely

    # Using the Speech SDK for batch transcription
    # The Azure Speech SDK for Python primarily supports real-time transcription.
    # For batch transcription, the REST API is typically used.
    # Let's adapt to use the REST API concept, as the SDK for batch is more complex.

    # This part requires calling the REST API for batch transcription.
    # The speechsdk.SpeechRecognizer is for real-time.
    # For batch, you'd use a different client.
    # Given the previous context was faster-whisper, let's adapt to simpler SDK usage
    # for demonstration, but note that for true batch of many files, REST API is more suitable.

    # Let's use the simpler real-time recognizer for demonstration,
    # assuming the audio files are not excessively long for this method.
    # For very long files, the batch REST API is the correct approach.
    # Given the user wants to get it working, this is a simpler path.

        # This means the upload to Blob Storage is currently just for demonstration of that step,
        # but the transcription itself will still happen from the local file using the SDK.
